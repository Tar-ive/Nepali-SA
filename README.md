Nepali Sentiment Analysis
This program uses machine learning to perform sentiment analysis on Nepali text. It is trained on a dataset of Nepali sentences with corresponding positive or negative sentiment labels.

Installation
To use this program, you need to have Python 3 and the following libraries installed:

pandas
scikit-learn
nltk
You can install them using pip:

Copy code
pip install pandas scikit-learn nltk
Usage
Clone this repository to your local machine.

Open the nepali_sentiment_analysis.ipynb notebook using Jupyter or Google Colab.

Run the notebook and follow the instructions to train the model on your own dataset or use the pre-trained model to predict sentiment on Nepali text.

Example
Here's an example of how to use the pre-trained model to predict sentiment on Nepali text:

python
Copy code
from nepali_sentiment_analysis import NepaliSentimentAnalyzer

# Load the pre-trained model
analyzer = NepaliSentimentAnalyzer()

# Predict sentiment on a list of Nepali sentences
sentences = ['केहि ठिक छैन।', 'मैले यो फिल्म मन पर्यो।', 'यो किताब राम्रो छ।']
predicted_sentiments = analyzer.predict(sentences)

# Print the predicted sentiments
print('Predicted sentiments:', predicted_sentiments)
This will output the predicted sentiment labels for each sentence.
